# NGINX
We will be using NGINX as a proxy to both kubernetes services and to specfic pods.
## Pod URL structure
WS connection:
/pod?ip=1p2p3p4&token=abc123
The query parameters will be extracted and used for the proxying to the pod.
## Security
It would be prudent to encrypt the NodeIP and token of a pod to obscure pod information. This can be done using a rotating key which is generated by the Agent, which also encrypts the key, and is sent to the nginx container on a per-minute basis. Let's save this for a future iteration.
